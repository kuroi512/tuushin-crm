## Tuushin CRM

Tuushin CRM is a Next.js + Prisma application for managing quotations, external shipment data, and synchronized master data from the Tuushin freight ecosystem. This document highlights the domain model, key processes, and how to get the project running locally.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies (pnpm is the default package manager):

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Copy environment variables and fill the required secrets:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Run the development database migrations and optional seed:

   ```bash
   pnpm prisma migrate dev
   pnpm prisma db seed   # optional, provides demo data
   ```

4. Start the dev server:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

   The application is now available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

| Entity                 | Description                                                                                  | Key relationships                                                                              |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `User`                 | Authentication entry for CRM staff and synced sales/manager accounts.                        | Creates/updates `Customer`, `Quotation`, `Shipment`, participates in rule snippets.            |
| `Customer`             | Companies or individuals requesting freight quotations.                                      | Linked to `Country`, `City`, owns many `Quotation` and `Shipment` records.                     |
| `Quotation`            | Core pricing document capturing routing, commercial terms, and computed profitability.       | References `Customer`, `User` (creator/owner), optional `Inquiry`, `Port` and `Currency` data. |
| `Shipment`             | Internal shipments derived from quotations.                                                  | Assigned to `User`, references `Customer`, mirrors external sync status.                       |
| `ExternalShipment`     | Tuushin external data synchronized from CRM integration.                                     | Groups by `ExternalShipmentSyncLog`, provides KPIs for dashboard metrics.                      |
| `MasterOption`         | Unified catalog of master data (type, ownership, country, port, area, sales, manager, etc.). | Drives dynamic selects on quotation forms and provisioning.                                    |
| `QuotationRuleSnippet` | Contains include/exclude/remark snippets applied to quotation documents.                     | Scoped by incoterm/transport mode, surfaced in quotation UI.                                   |

## Code style and git hooks

- Prettier enforces formatting and EditorConfig aligns core editor behavior.
- Husky + lint-staged auto-format staged files on commit and run a pre-push check.
- Run `pnpm format` to format the repo manually or `pnpm format:check` in CI.
- Hooks are configured through the `prepare` script. Re-run `pnpm prepare` if needed.

## Master data sync and user provisioning

- `POST /api/master/sync` imports external master options into `master_options`.
- During sync, active `SALES` and `MANAGER` entries provision login users with roles `SALES` / `MANAGER`.
- Emails default to `first.last@tuushin.local` (or use `meta.email` when supplied).
- `DEFAULT_USER_PASSWORD` sets the initial password (fallback: `ChangeMe123!`).
- Run `POST /api/master/provision-users` to provision accounts without a full sync.
- Detailed sync behaviour is documented in `docs/MASTER_DATA_SYNC.md`.

After first login, users should update their password (UI flow forthcoming).
